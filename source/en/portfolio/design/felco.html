      <p>
        <strong class="strong-text">Felco</strong> is one of the most well-known high quality cutting tools in the world. A few years ago it came to Russia, and our purpose was to make it popular here.
      </p>
      <p>
        This leaflet is just one of our graphic arts from a big number of projects - banners, magazine adverts and other POS materials. Now every professional gardener, landscaper and farmer knows about Felco. Of course, it's a specialised market, not for everyone. But now, popularization of these tools makes more professionals from rookies!
      </p>
      <p>
        So if You want to export your products to Russia, we'll be glad to help You to sweep this market.
