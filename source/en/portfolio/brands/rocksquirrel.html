      <p>
        <strong class="strong-text">RockSquirrel</strong> is one of our creatively different original brands.  We've build it from scratch, and that's why it looks so special. The main idea of this brand was to be assotiated with youthfulness, energy and economy at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why we decide to use squirrel as a symbol. It's one of the most active animals, but also provident. Why Rock Squirrel? We still don't really know, but this squirrel with a guitar set us fire indeed!
      </p>
      <p>
        Also we use some traditional rules of a cafe branding - shades of brown colour and rounded shapes are used to calm nerves and tempt the appetite of our visitors. So now it's one of the most advanced and promising brands of HoReCa industry by Webmassa.
