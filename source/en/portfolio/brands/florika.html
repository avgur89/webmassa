      <p>
        <strong class="strong-text">Florika</strong> is a full development of a brand, from the beginning to the first sales of potting mixtures. Made only for indoor plants, this is one of the best choises in Russian DIY market.  The main thing that we had to describe in a design was "How carefully our consumers can grow their plants using this mix".
      </p>
      <p>
        Thats why we took children for a photo-set - they're young and tender like our new seedlings. And our young models remind about that. The logo consists from the leaf and letter "F" inside it. This form continues in frames around photos. And every package is colourful and laconic at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later we've made an advertizing campaign for this product, and it still continues. Now Florika is one of the most powerful brands of soil mixtures on Russian market!
