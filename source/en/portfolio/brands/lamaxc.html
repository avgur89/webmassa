      <p>
        <strong class="strong-text">LamaXC</strong> is a small bike park on the river Lama in Moscow region. Before we started to invite the first visitors using landing page, we had to create a good brand for this place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the park is located on the hills near the river, we decided to show this in a shape of a logo. The word "Lama" was written in a way that reminds us both the contour of the hills and water stream.
      </p>
      <p>
        This style continues in the shapes of Lama XC landing page blocks. This is what we call sport minimalism. Everything is simple and clear - that's how to deliver the main idea of a brand faster.
