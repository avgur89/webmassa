      <p>
        <strong class="strong-text">Advert Ace</strong> is an advertizing and marketing services company. Before we start to develop a website for this project we should brand it. AdvertAce means "advertizing that hits the target". And that's why we used tennis ball and racket as the main symbols of the brand.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the logo was made we also designed backgrounds and icons for the website. Everything in this branding work has a meaning. And we've built a complete picture of the brand: it's a sportive advertizing that always takes a good aim.
      </p>
